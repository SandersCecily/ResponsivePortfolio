# ResponsivePortfolio

## Introduction

This is a recreation of the original portfolio project that was done. The point of a new repository was to capture the difference between the two. The main difference here is that there is CSS in play that makes this version more mobile responsive hence the name Responsive Portfoliio.  

## Technologies

This portfolio uses CSS and HTML like the first.
